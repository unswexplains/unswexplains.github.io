# Proposal: UNSW Explains (UNSWX)

## Problem

- We are relying on academics to write content, but they are often slow/late and the results are often poor quality.
- This is due to a combination of lack of interest, lack of skill, lack of time. We need people who are interested, have the skill, and have the time.

## Related issue

- Universities do not share their understanding very well with the general public.
- That's a missed opportunity for both parties.

## The idea

- Have a team of people who specialise in writing well and explaining things clearly
- They are interested, have the skill, and have the time.
- They liaise with academics to build a library of explanations, which can be deployed in various ways.
- 20min topics
- Gadgets

## What we need

- Easy to create
- Easy to maintain
- Searchable
- Dependencies cared for
- Easy to use in regular courses, UNSWO, microcreds, Mentem
- Version control, collaboration

## A possible solution

- Use markdown
- Use GitHub

## Other services

- Run courses on how to explain things
- Publish books
