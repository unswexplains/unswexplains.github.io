      $ The problem with small samples    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Sometimes we use a sample to learn things about a larger population. The hope is that the sample is representative of the population, which means that summary facts about the sample are the same as the corresponding summary facts about the population. If so, then we can use summary facts about the sample to learn things about the population. Because of random fluctuations, we can't be sure that a sample is representative of its population. But there are two things we can do to maximise the likelihood that the sample is representative: choose the sample without bias; choose a large enough sample. Here we consider sample size.</p>
<h1>The problem with small samples</h1>
<p>They are more likley to have extreme proportions.</p>
<p>We can see this by considering an extreme case - a sample of just one person. Suppose the actual proportion of town people in favour of a new pool is 50% (i.e. half the town). Suppose you choose one person from town at random, without bias. The proportion of the sample in favour of a new pool is either 100% (if this person is in favour) or 0% (if this person is not in favour), neither of which is the same as the proportion of the town. So your sample is not representative of the town, even though you chose the sample without bias. It doesn't matter who you choose - the proportion of the sample will be either 100% or 0%. So a sample of one person will never be representative (even if it's chosen without bias).</p>
<p>What if you choose two people at random? Then you'll either get two people in favour, which is a proportion of 100%, or two people not in favour, which is a proportion of 0%, or one of each, which is a proportion of 50%. Here are the possibilities in a table:</p>
<pre><code>Person1       Person2       Proportion
------------- ------------- ----------
In favour     In favour           100%
In favour     Not in favour        50%
Not in favour In favour            50%
Not in favour Not in favour         0%</code></pre>
<p>You <em>might</em> end up with a representative sample in this case, so it's better than choosing just one person. But you're just as likely not to.</p>
<p>It turns out that the bigger the sample, the more likely it is to have the same proportion as the population. This is a mathematical fact, known as <strong>the law of large numbers</strong>. What it means is that you can increase the likelihood of your sample being representative by increasing its size.</p>
<h1>Illustration: kidney cancer</h1>
<p>Kahneman Chapter 10.</p>
<p>Example from Howard Wainer and Harris Zwerling.</p>
<p>A study of the incidence of kidney cancer in the 3,141 counties of the United States. Counties with the lowest rate of kidney cancer: mostly rural, sparsely populated. We look for a causal explanation - clean living: no air or water pollution, fresh food without additives.</p>
<p>But, the conties with the highest rates of kidney cancer: mostly rural, sparsely populated. Again look for causal explanations: poor access to medical care, high fat diet, alcohol, tobacco.</p>
<p>But both cannot be right!</p>
<p>The problem is that we're trying to find a causal explanation for a non-causal phenomenon. It's a statistical phenomenon.</p>
<h1>Illustration</h1>
<p>Here's a simulation that illustrates the danger of working with small samples.</p>
<p>Suppose that in a population of 120 people, everyone has an equal 50% chance of developing a certain condition. Suppose they live in communities of various sizes, from 1 person to 64 people, as shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p>If you click the &quot;Distribute the condition&quot; button, the condition will be distributed across the population, with everyone having an equal 50% chance of developing the condition. The proportion of each community that develop the condition is shown, and colour coded according to how extreme it is -- the further from 50%, the more red. Try clicking the button a few times.</p>
<button onclick="rollDice()">Distribute the condition</button>
<table id="diceRolls">
  <tr><td>1</td><td rowspan="2">4</td><td rowspan="4">16</td><td rowspan="8">64</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td rowspan="2">4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td rowspan="2">4</td><td rowspan="4">16</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td rowspan="2">4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
<style>
  #diceRolls td {height: 1em; width: 2em}
  #diceRolls td[rowspan="2"] {width: 4em}
  #diceRolls td[rowspan="4"] {width: 8em}
  #diceRolls td[rowspan="8"] {width: 16em}
</style>
<script>
  function rollDice() {
    document.querySelectorAll("#diceRolls td").forEach((elt) => {
      let numDice = (elt.getAttribute("rowspan") || 1)**2;
      let rolls = Array(numDice).fill(0).map(x => Math.round(Math.random()));
      let numHeads = rolls.reduce((x, y) => x + y, 0);
      let percent = Math.round(numHeads/numDice*100)
      let deviation = Math.round(256*Math.abs(percent - 50)/50);
      let [r, g, b] = [256, (256-deviation), (256-deviation)]; 
      elt.style.backgroundColor = "rgb("+r+","+g+","+b+")";
      elt.innerText = percent+"%";
    });
  }
</script>
<p>Notice that the smallest communities tend to have the most extreme proportions - either a high proportion with the condition, or a high proportion without the condition. This is not because those communities are more prone to the condition, or more resistant to it - after all, everyone in the population has an equal 50% chance of developing it. It is just because those communities are small.</p>
<h1>Another illustration</h1>
<p>Here's another way to illustrate the point.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a fair coin and toss it 100 times. As we go, we record the proportion of heads that we've tossed. You can click the &quot;Toss the coin&quot; button below to see it in action.</p>
<button onclick="tosses=[];toss()">Toss the coin</button>
<div id="coinToss"></div>
<script>
  let tosses = [];
  plot();
  function toss() {
    tosses.push(Math.floor(Math.random()*2));
    plot();
    if (tosses.length < 101) setTimeout(toss, 5);
    else document.getElementById("tossButton").disabled = false;
  }
  function plot() {
    let averages = [];
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < tosses.length; i++) {
      sum += tosses[i];
      averages.push(Math.round(sum/(i+1)*100));
    }
    Highcharts.chart("coinToss", {
      title: {text: "Proportion of heads while tossing a fair coin 100 times"},
      tooltip: {enabled: false},
      xAxis: {min: 0, max: 100, minorTicks: true, startOnTick: true, endOnTick: true, title: {text: "Number of tosses"}},
      yAxis: {min: 0, max: 100, tickInterval: 10, startOnTick: true, endOnTick: true, minorTicks: false, title: {text: "Proportion of heads"}, labels: {format: "{value}%"}, plotLines: [{value: 50, color: 'green', dashStyle: 'shortdash', width: 4, zIndex: 5}]},
      series: [
        {type: 'line', lineWidth: 4, data: averages, animation: false, showInLegend: false},
      ]
    });
  }
</script>
<p>Notice that after just a few tosses the proportion of heads tends to be extreme -- either extremely high or extremely low. But as we toss the coin more times the proportion tends to become less extreme, approaching roughly 50%. Try clicking the button a few times.</p>
<h1>How large is large enough?</h1>
<p>How large is large enough? There are carefully worked out ways to calculate this, developed by statisticians over hundreds of years. But, as a rule of thumb, if you're sampling without bias, then once you reach a sample size of 1000, you can be quite confident that the sample is representative of the population, and increasing the sample size further is unlikely to be worth the effort.</p>
<p>Suppose a sample is chosen using an unbiased sampling method. Suppose we use the sample proportion as an estimate of the population proportion. We can calculate a confidence interval as well. Must choose a confidence level first. The width is twice the margin of error (MOE).</p>
<p>Interpretation. Suppose our 95% confidence interval is 0.80-0.84. If we were to repeat the same process many times (same population, same sampling method, same sample size, same calculation), the difference between the sample proportion and the true population proportion will be within the margin of error about 95% of the time. It's a measure of how good the process is. Note: we can't be sure that it will always be within the MOE.</p>
<p>As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. But there is a diminishing return from taking larger and larger samples. The margin of error for most sample estimates depends directly on the square root of the size of the sample, $\sqrt{n}$.</p>
<p>For large random samples a 95% confidence interval for a population proportion is given by</p>
<p>$$ \text{sample proportion} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\text{sample proportion}(1-\text{sample proportion})}{n}} $$</p>
<div id="moecurve"></div>
<script>
  let xs = [];
  let max = 2000;
  for (let i = max/100; i <= max; i += max/100) xs.push(i);
  Highcharts.chart("moecurve", {
    chart: {type: "line"},
    title: {text: "Sample size and the 95% confidence interval"},
    tooltip: {pointFormat: "{series.name}: <b>&pm;{point.y:.2f}%<br/>"},
    xAxis: {min: 0, max: max, title: {text: "Sample size"}, tickInterval: 100},
    yAxis: {min: 0, max: 15, title: {text: "95% confidence interval"}, tickInterval: 1, labels: {useHTML: true, format: "&pm;{value}%"}, plotLines: [{value: 3, color: "green", width: 2, dashStyle: "shortdash", zIndex: 5}]},
    plotOptions: {series: {animation: false, showInLegend: false}},
    series: [
      {name: "95% confidence interval", data: xs.map(x => [x, 196*Math.sqrt((0.4*0.6)/x)])},
    ]
  });
</script>
<p>Notice that the amount by which the margin of error decreases is most substantial between samples sizes of 200 and 1500. In contrast, the margin of error does not substantially decrease at sample sizes above 1500 (since it is already below 3%). </p>
<p>Many surveys are based on samples of size 1000 to 1500 people. Why is this sample size so commonly used? The answer is based on the margin of error. For a sample size of n = 1000, the margin of error for a sample proportion is around $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1000}} \approx 0.03$ or about 3%. It's quite a bit of work to reduce that using just the sample size.</p>
<p>For example, To cut the margin of error in half, like from 3.2% down to 1.6%, you need four times as big of a sample, like going from 1000 to 4000 respondents.</p>
<p>Since other problems inherent in surveys may often cause biases of a percent or two, pollsters often believe that it is not worth the expense to achieve the small improvement in the margin of error that might be gained by increasing the sample size further. It's rarely worth it for pollsters to spend additional time and money to bring the margin of error down below 3% or so. The whole point of sampling is to save us the time, effort and money involved in asking a lot of people, so it's a tradeoff - you want a sample that is small enough to be feasible, but large enough to be likely to be representative. </p>
<p>The size of the population does not affect the margin of error. So, a percentage estimated from a sample will have the same margin of error (reliability), regardless of whether the population size is 50,000 or 5 billion.</p>	  </main>
