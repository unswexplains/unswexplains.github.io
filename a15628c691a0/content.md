Suck all the good stuff out of "How to lie with statistics".

# Check that you have permission to share the data with the audience

This is different from having permission to use it.

# Be careful with personal data

# Don't lie

This should go without saying. Charts must be accurate. When you produce a communication, you become a source. You will need to be as honest as you would like your sources to be.

Apart from being morally wrong, it is also imprudent - you will quickly lose the trust of your audience, and that trust can be very hard to regain.

# Don't mislead

Again, for two reasons: it is morally wrong, and you will lose the trust of your audience. Especially if you do it intentionally. But even if you do it accidentally, you will still lose some trust, although of a different kind.

# Reveal your data sources

You should indicate your sources. It's a way of validating that you didn't just make this information up. People can check to see if you're skewing or misrepresenting your story.

The other reason is some people may want to learn more about the subject, and they'll want to know where you obtained your data.

For visualisations, a good way is to add a caption.

# Don't cherry-pick your findings

It is tempting, but it can lose you trust. E.g. positive comments from customers. Showing the negative data can actually make people *more* inclined to be persuaded.

# Don't be overly precise

Don't be more precise than the data warrants. Precision suggests accuracy. This is a danger when taking averages. e.g. 2.765643.

# Don't leave people at the mercy of their biases

Don't encourage jumping to conclusions.

Be aware that people will jump to conclusions, especially causal. Have a duty to not propagate this. Even if you add disclaimers, people will naturally ignore them.

# Don't enforce stereotypes

Be aware of enforcing stereotypes.

# Using mean or median

They might give different values, and if so then you can choose the one to best suit your interests. But be careful doing so.

# Misleading with charts

x Axis. Don't have gaps in the scales.

y-Axis limits. Should usually start at 0.

Bar charts should nearly always start at 0. Because the height of the bars means something.

With a line chart it's often okay to show a limited range. 

Ask: will skeptics buy this?

Ask: will believers be too accepting?

Scales with small multiples. Be careful when using different scales that might be mistaken for the same, e.g. because of how they are placed. Best to keep the same scale throughout a design. If have to use different scales, try changing the orientation so that user sees a noticeable difference.
