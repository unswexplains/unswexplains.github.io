%% $ Responsibly presenting data %%

Suck all the good stuff out of "How to lie with statistics".

# Check that you have permission to share the data with the audience

This is different from having permission to use it.

Like borrowing a lawn mower - don't get authority to decide to share it with. Not like ownership.

# Reveal your data sources

You should indicate your sources. It's a way of validating that you didn't just make this information up. People can check to see if you're skewing or misrepresenting your story.

The other reason is some people may want to learn more about the subject, and they'll want to know where you obtained your data.

For visualisations, a good way is to add a caption.

# Be careful with personal data

# Don't lie

This should go without saying. Charts must be accurate. When you produce a communication, you become a source. You will need to be as honest as you would like your sources to be.

Apart from being morally wrong, it is also imprudent - you will quickly lose the trust of your audience, and that trust can be very hard to regain.

# Don't mislead

Again, for two reasons: it is morally wrong, and you will lose the trust of your audience. Especially if you do it intentionally. But even if you do it accidentally, you will still lose some trust, although of a different kind.

# Don't cherry-pick your findings

It is tempting, but it can lose you trust. E.g. positive comments from customers, student feedback. Showing the negative data can actually make people *more* inclined to be persuaded. They're aware that there'll be such negative data, so showing it does no harm, and in fact increases their trust in you. Not showing it only does harm. Compare: watching guests on QnA.

# Don't be overly precise

Don't be more precise than the data warrants. Precision suggests accuracy. This is a danger when taking averages. e.g. 2.765643.

# Don't leave people at the mercy of their biases

Don't encourage jumping to conclusions.

Go to class!

Be aware that people will jump to conclusions, especially causal. Have a duty to not propagate this. Even if you add disclaimers, people will naturally ignore them.

# Don't enforce stereotypes

Be aware of enforcing stereotypes.

# Using mean or median

They might give different values, and if so then you can choose the one to best suit your interests. But be careful doing so.

Mean is not the same as correct. Mean height, mean intelligence.

Using mean can mislead: mean number of bedrooms, mean gestation period, mean mark, mean daily temperature. What we need is a range instead or as well. Especially when there's a spread.

# Ratios

Be careful when comparing when other things have changed.

More accidents occur on bends.

Number going to church has increased, but proportion has decreased. People are getting paid more now, but buying power has dropped.

# Percentages

\$10 down to \$5. Save 100% or save 50%.

Buy for 3 and sell for 4. How much profit? 1/3 or 1/4?

Increases from 20% to 40%. How much increase? 20%? 100%? 50%? Percentage points.

# Misleading with charts

x Axis. Don't have gaps in the scales.

y-Axis limits. Should usually start at 0. Otherwise it accentuates changes.

Bar charts should nearly always start at 0. Because the height of the bars means something.

With a line chart it's often okay to show a limited range. 

Ask: will skeptics buy this?

Ask: will believers be too accepting?

Scales with small multiples. Be careful when using different scales that might be mistaken for the same, e.g. because of how they are placed. Best to keep the same scale throughout a design. If have to use different scales, try changing the orientation so that user sees a noticeable difference.

Scaling multiple dimensions.
