      <h1>Marathon times</h1>
<p>At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, there were 76 finishers in the men's marathon, and 73 finishers in the women's. Here's a sample of their finishing times (in minutes), combined into one table:</p>
<pre><code>Gender   Time
------ ------
Male   128.63
Male   129.97
Male   130.00
...
Male   151.85
Male   153.37
Male   164.60
Female 147.33
Female 147.60
Female 147.77
...
Female 175.65
Female 182.17
Female 183.17</code></pre>
<p>How do the men's times compare with each other? How about the women's times? And how do the men's times compare with the women's?</p>
<p>By sorting the rows, we can see the fastest and slowest times for each gender, and compare them, but that doesn't tell us much about how they're all distributed.</p>
<p>It helps to calculate the so-called &quot;five number summary&quot; for each gender. Here they are, together in a table:</p>
<pre><code>Gender Minimum     Q1 Median     Q3 Maximum
------ ------- ------ ------ ------ -------
Male    128.63 135.13 137.53 141.63  164.60
Female  147.33 153.23 155.65 160.07  183.17</code></pre>
<p>The five number summary of a variable is a commonly used statistical description of its values. It includes the minimum value, the first quartile value (Q1) (the value below which 25% of the values lie), the median value (the middle value, or the value below which 50% of the values lie), the third quartile value (Q3) (the value below which 75% of the values lie), and the maximum value.</p>
<p>From these five number summaries we can see that the fastest man was faster than the fastest woman, that some men were slower than some women, and so on. But it takes a bit of time and mental effort to process them, and it's still hard to get a sense of how the times are distributed.</p>
<h1>Two visualisations</h1>
<p>We can get a much better sense of what the five number summaries are telling us, by visualising them. One way is to use what are called &quot;boxplots&quot;:</p>
<div id="boxes"></div>
<script src="https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts-more.js"></script>
<script>
  Highcharts.chart("boxes", {
    chart: {type: 'boxplot', inverted: true},
    title: {text: "Distribution of Marathon Times at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics"},
    legend: {enabled: false},
    xAxis: {categories: ["Men","Women"], title: {text: ''}},
    yAxis: {min: 125, max: 185, title: {text: 'Finishing time (minutes)'}},
    series: [{
      name: 'Men',
      data: [
        {low: 128.63, q1: 135.13, median: 137.53, q3: 141.63, high: 164.60},
        {low: 147.33, q1: 153.23, median: 155.65, q3: 160.07, high: 183.17}
      ]
    }]
  });
</script>
<p>There's a box for each gender, and it shows the five number summary for that gender: the minimum time, the first quartile time, the median time, the third quartile time, and the maximum time. We can see at a glance from these boxes, with hardly any effort, that the men were generally faster than the women, but also that there is overlap, so that the fastest women were faster than the slowest men.</p>
<p>We can also see quite a bit about the distributions by visualising the raw data directly. Here's one way, using what's called a &quot;scatter plot&quot;:</p>
<div id="points"></div>
<script>
  Highcharts.chart("points", {
    chart: {type: 'scatter', inverted: true},
    title: {text: "Distribution of Marathon Times at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics"},
    legend: {enabled: false},
    xAxis: {categories: ["","Men","Women",""], title: {text: ''}, gridLineWidth: 1},
    yAxis: {min: 125, max: 185, title: {text: 'Finishing time (minutes)'}},
    series: [{
      jitter: {x: 0.2, y: 0},
      marker: {radius: 8, fillColor: "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.25)"},
      data: [
        // Men
        [1,128.63],[1,129.97],[1,130],[1,130.03],[1,130.27],[1,130.68],[1,131.58],[1,131.68],[1,131.97],[1,132.22],[1,132.37],[1,132.83],[1,133.03],[1,133.37],[1,133.48],[1,134.03],[1,134.55],[1,134.8],[1,134.97],[1,135.18],[1,135.35],[1,135.57],[1,135.83],[1,135.85],[1,135.93],[1,136.13],[1,136.27],[1,136.28],[1,136.43],[1,136.55],[1,136.58],[1,136.65],[1,136.7],[1,136.72],[1,136.95],[1,137.07],[1,137.28],[1,137.32],[1,137.73],[1,137.98],[1,138.45],[1,138.47],[1,138.57],[1,138.65],[1,138.67],[1,139.45],[1,139.73],[1,139.95],[1,140.6],[1,140.72],[1,140.88],[1,141],[1,141.25],[1,141.48],[1,141.53],[1,141.53],[1,141.58],[1,141.75],[1,142.1],[1,142.2],[1,142.25],[1,142.38],[1,142.83],[1,143.2],[1,143.68],[1,144.07],[1,145.05],[1,145.62],[1,146.13],[1,146.98],[1,147.8],[1,148.72],[1,150.13],[1,151.85],[1,153.37],[1,164.6],

      ]

<p>Each of the 76 male finishers, and 73 female finishers, is represented by a point that shows their finishing time. This scatter plot allows us to see many of the same general features that the boxplots do.</p>
<p>Our brains can process information much more quickly and easily when it's presented visually in these ways, rather than as raw numbers.</p>
<h1>Some other examples</h1>
<p>There are many websites that illustrate the effectiveness of visualising data. Here are some especially good ones. Notice, in each case, how the visualisations make it quick and easy to comprehend a large amount of complex data.</p>

<p>There's also a TED talk by Hans Rosling, famous for its use of data visualisation. If you haven't already seen it, you might like to watch it some time (it goes for about 20 minutes).</p>

<h1>The lesson of Anscombe's quartet</h1>
<p>As we've seen, visualisations can make it quick and easy to comprehend raw data. They can also prevent us from being misled by that data, especially numerical summaries of it. There's a nice illustration of this fact, created in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe.</p>
<h1>Anscombe's four data sets</h1>
<p>Anscombe created four data sets, each of which has eleven cases and two variables, called &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Here are the four data sets, combined into a single table:</p>
<pre><code>    Set 1      Set 2      Set 3      Set 4
   x     y    x     y    x     y    x     y
  10  8.04   10  9.14   10  7.46    8  6.58
   8  6.95    8  8.14    8  6.77    8  5.76
  13  7.58   13  8.74   13 12.74    8  7.71
   9  8.81    9  8.77    9  7.11    8  8.84
  11  8.33   11  9.26   11  7.81    8  8.47
  14  9.96   14  8.10   14  8.84    8  7.04
   6  7.24    6  6.13    6  6.08    8  5.25
   4  4.26    4  3.10    4  5.39   19 12.50
  12 10.84   12  9.13   12  8.15    8  5.56
   7  4.82    7  7.26    7  6.42    8  7.91
   5  5.68    5  4.74    5  5.73    8  6.89</code></pre>
<h1>Their numerical summaries</h1>
<p>The four data sets have nearly identical numerical summaries. Their x variables have the same mean (9) and the same variance (11). Their y variables have the same mean (7.50) and almost the same variance (approximately 4.125). Their x and y variables are correlated to almost the same degree (approximately 0.8163). And the lines of best fit between their x and y variables have the same intercept (approximately 3.00), the same slope (approximately 0.500), and thus the same equation (y = 3.00 + 0.500x). (You don't need to fully understand these summaries - just notice that they're the same, or nearly the same, for all four data sets).</p>
<pre><code>                              Set 1  Set 2  Set 3  Set 4
Mean of x:                        9      9      9      9
Variance of x:                   11     11     11     11
Mean of y:                     7.50   7.50   7.50   7.50
Variance of y:                4.127  4.128  4.123  4.123
Correlation between x and y:  0.816  0.816  0.816  0.817
----
Line of best fit in each case: y = 3.00 + 0.500x</code></pre>
<h1>Their visualisations</h1>
<p>Despite having nearly identical numerical summaries, the four data sets have very different distributions, as you can see from the following visualisations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">svg()
par(mfrow=c(2,2), pch=19)
plot(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1, xlim=c(0,20), ylim=c(0,14), main="Data set 1", xlab="x", ylab="y")
plot(anscombe$x2, anscombe$y2, xlim=c(0,20), ylim=c(0,14), main="Data set 2", xlab="x", ylab="y")
plot(anscombe$x3, anscombe$y3, xlim=c(0,20), ylim=c(0,14), main="Data set 3", xlab="x", ylab="y")
plot(anscombe$x4, anscombe$y4, xlim=c(0,20), ylim=c(0,14), main="Data set 4", xlab="x", ylab="y")</code></pre>	  </main>
