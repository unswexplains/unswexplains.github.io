      Why care about data?    </header>
    <main>
      <p>People are increasingly recognising the value of data, and putting more money and effort into getting and using it. Why? What's so good about data? </p>
<p>Essentially, this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data gives us useful knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it <em>can</em> give us useful knowledge. It depends on two things.</p>
<p>First, <strong>the data must be correct</strong>. Incorrect data cannot give us knowledge, useful or otherwise. Suppose you've collected data about the weights of some mice, but your scales were broken and gave the wrong readings. Then your data is incorrect, and you can't know anything about the weights of the mice, no matter what you do with the data. If you don't realise the data is mistaken then you might come to believe various things about the weights, and some of those beliefs might, by sheer luck, be true. But the beliefs aren't knowledge, and they might lead you astray.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>we must engage with the data</strong>, which means actively using it. There are five key ways that we can use data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspect it</li>
<li>Analyse it</li>
<li>Use it to learn about a population</li>
<li>Use it to make predictions</li>
<li>Use it to learn about causation</li>
</ul>
<h1>Inspecting data</h1>
<p>Suppose you're the president of the local beekeeping club. You have a database of members, which contains their names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, dates of joining, and so on. This is your <strong>raw data</strong>. By inspecting this raw data you can come to know all sorts of useful things. What's so-and-so's phone number? When is her birthday? When did she join the club? This knowledge can help you work more effectively with your members.</p>
<h1>Analysing data</h1>
<p>You can come to know a variety of other things too, by <em>analysing</em> your raw data. How many members live out of town? What's their average age? Who is the oldest? How are membership numbers trending? None of this information is recorded <em>explicitly</em> in the raw data, but it's all there <em>implicitly</em>, and you can expose it by analysing the data.</p>
<p>Knowledge you get by analysing the raw data tends to be more useful than what you get by merely inspecting it. You can get some real insights about the nature of your members, how they compare, and how things are trending.</p>
<h1>Using data to learn about a population</h1>
<p>Those first two ways of using data - inspecting it, and analysing it - involve getting knowledge from <em>within</em> your data - it's all there already, either explicitly (when is so-and-so's birthday?) or implicitly (what's the average age of our members?). You can also get knowledge that goes <em>beyond</em> your data.</p>
<p>Suppose you're thinking about running a membership campaign for your beekeeping club, and you'd like to know what proportion of the town are interested in keeping bees. </p>
<p>You don't have the resources to ask everyone, so you ask a sample of people instead. You find that 35% of the sample are interested, and you conclude that 35% of the whole town are interested too. In this case your data is just about the sample. But you come to know something about the whole town. What you learn goes beyond your data - it's not <em>explicitly</em> in your data, and it's not <em>implicitly</em> there either.</p>
<p>The knowledge you get when you use data in this way is of a slightly different kind than in the previous two ways. It's <em>probabilistic</em> knowledge. What you come to know is not that 35% of the town are interested in beekeeping, but that it's <em>likely</em> that 35% of the town are interested. </p>
<p>This is a powerful technique, and it can yield very useful knowledge. It can help governments, for example, plan housing developments and the associated infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals. It's backed by a well worked out science, called <strong>inferential statistics</strong>.</p>
<h1>Using data to make predictions</h1>
<p>Suppose that each summer your beekeeping club has a honey making event. Members of the club extract honey from their hives, and experiment with different blends. To help plan, you'd like to be able to predict how much honey will be produced each time.</p>
<p>You can use data to help with this. You suspect that the amount of honey is closely related to how much rain there was during the preceding spring. You gather some data about rainfall over the last ten springs, and combine it with data you have about the amount of honey extracted in the subsequent summers. You notice that there does indeed seem to be a relationship. The following equation fits the data very closely (not perfectly, but closely), and better than any other equation:</p>
<p>$$ \text{Amount of honey (in kg)} = 3.5 + 12.7 \times \text{Amount of rain (in mm)} $$</p>
<p>Armed with this equation, you can now predict how much honey will be produced in any given summer. </p>
<p>When you use data in this way, you're again going beyond the data, and the knowledge you get is again probabilistic. If your equation predicts there'll be 65kg of honey this coming summer, what you come to know is not that there <em>will</em> be 65kg, but that there's <em>likely</em> to be 65kg.</p>
<p>This is another powerful technique, supported by another well worked out science, called <strong>predictive analytics</strong>.</p>
<h1>Using data to learn about causation</h1>
<p>Suppose one of your beekeeping members has been trying a new way of extracting honey from honeycomb, and it seems to get more of the honey than traditional methods. It's a more expensive process, but if it works the way it seems to then the cost is worth it. The question is, does it work the way it seems to?</p>
<p>You can use data to answer this question, by conducting a <strong>controlled experiment</strong>. You randomly assign batches of honeycomb to two groups, one of which is treated using the new method, the other of which is treated using the traditional method. You find that the group that uses the new method has a higher yield than the other group, higher than you would expect by random chance. You conclude that the new method really works.</p>
<p>Just like the previous two ways of using data, this way involves going beyond your data, and the knowledge you get is probabilistic. What you come to know is not that the new method <em>definitely</em> works, but that it's <em>likely</em> to work.</p>
<p>This is a third powerful technique, also supported by a well worked out science.</p>
<h1>The perils of not using data</h1>
<p>Sometimes we don't bother using data, because we think we already know what we need to know. But we need to be careful, because we don't always know what we think we do.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that we employ heuristics in our thinking - shortcuts that make our thinking easier. These heuristics are generally helpful, but they can lead us astray. Using data prevents being misled, by providing an objective reality check.</p>
<p>Two such heuristics are the availability heuristic, and the representativeness heuristic.</p>
<p><strong>The availability heuristic</strong>. Do more words start with &quot;k&quot;, or have &quot;k&quot; as their third letter? Many people judge that the former is true, even though it's actually the latter. Why do we get it wrong? Because we employ an &quot;availability heuristic&quot; - we use ease of recall as a proxy for frequency. Since it's easier to recall words that start with &quot;k&quot; than words that have &quot;k&quot; as their third letter, we judge the former to be more numerous. Often the heuristic works, but it doesn't in this case - we'd be better off relying on data instead. (You can read more about this in the introduction to &quot;Thinking, fast and slow&quot;, by Daniel Kahneman.)</p>
<p>Here's a more serious example. Gerd Gigerenzer analysed driving fatalities in the US in the three months following the September 11 terrorist attacks. (See &quot;Dread risk, September 11, and fatal traffic accidents&quot; in <em>Psychological science</em>, <strong>15</strong>, pp. 286-287, 2004). His analysis suggests, he says, that &quot;the number of Americans who lost their lives on the road by avoiding the risk of flying was higher than the total number of passengers killed on the four fatal flights.&quot; People were overestimating the risks of flying, and underestimating the risks of driving, because the former were more available to them at the time. They could have kept themselves safer by relying upon data about road versus terrorist fatalities, rather than relying upon availability.</p>
<p><strong>The representativeness heuristic</strong>. Consider Linda: she is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright; she majored in philosophy; as a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable?</p>
<ul>
<li>Linda is a bank teller</li>
<li>Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people choose the second option. But this cannot be correct: being a bank teller and active in the feminist movement is more specific than being a bank teller, and the probability of being the more specific thing cannot be greater than the probability of being the more general thing. Why do we get it wrong? Because we employ a &quot;representativeness heuristic&quot; - we use representativeness as a proxy for probability. Linda is more representative of a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement than a general bank teller, so we judge it to be more probable that she's bank teller who is active in the feminist movement. Our stereotypes lead us astray. (For more details, see Chapter 15 of &quot;Thinking, fast and slow&quot;, by Daniel Kahneman.)</p>
<p>Relying on stereotypes to make judgments is a risky business - it leaves us prone to making false assumptions about humans and other things. We're better off relying on actual data.</p>
<h1>Data is even more useful today</h1>
<p>We've been collecting and using data for thousands of years, and many of the techniques and principles have been well understood since the 1800s. But data collection and use are becoming even more important today. Why?</p>
<p>It's largely because of the following, much of which is due to advances in technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We have more data than before, because we have better ways of collecting it (social media, electronic sales, satellite imagery, etc.), and a greater capacity to store it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of this data is available to us, via our own organisations or in public data repositories (e.g. government websites, and websites such as Kaggle).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have better tools for working with data - for analysing, modelling and visualising it (e.g. Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, Python, and R).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a more extensive suite of sophisticated machine learning techniques, and computers that are powerful enough to implement them. Some techniques have been known about for decades, but only recently have the abilities of computers made them accessible to everyday data scientists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is more widespread education about data and how to use it.</p>
