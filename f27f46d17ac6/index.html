      $ Respecting data ownership    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Data can be owned. If it is, and if you are not the owner, then you need to make sure you have permission to use it. It's the same as with other things that are owned.</p>
<h1>Data ownership</h1>
<p>Data ownership refers to who owns data and if rights to that data can be transferred. There are three levels of data ownership:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteered data</li>
<li>Observed data</li>
<li>Derived data</li>
</ul>
<h1>Volunteered data</h1>
<p>Volunteered data is personal information that individuals have explicitly shared with an organisation. Is likely to be fairly insensitive. Examples include name, address, and email when creating an account via a website.</p>
<h1>Observed data</h1>
<p>Observed data is information that an organisation has captured or recorded passively. In other words, an individual has not explicitly shared this information. It is likely to have a higher level of sensitivity than volunteered data. Examples include mobile phone and web usage behaviour.</p>
<h1>Derived data</h1>
<p>Derived data is information which has been created through analysis, such as an organisation putting together pieces of information from various sources. It is likely to be the most sensitive data. One example is Target using data analytics to detect a personâ€™s pregnancy.</p>
<p>In derived data, an organisation has gone to great lengths to track a particular person, therefore, this information tends to be highly valuable. As such, it is not usually information that people would want to be freely available, in fact, people are likely not even comfortable with an organisation having the data.</p>	  </main>
