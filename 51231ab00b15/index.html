      $ The problem with biased samples    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Small samples tend to be extreme, not representative of the population. Having a large sample minimises that risk.</p>
<p>That is, as long as the selection technique is not biased. Even large samples can be unrepresentative (have a disproportinate value), if the selection technique is biased.</p>
<p>Be aware that getting a large sample is not enough by itself - you also need to use an unbiased selection method. If your selection method is biased, then it might be impossible to get a representative sample, no matter how large the sample is. We can illustrate this fact using an extreme example. Return to your survey about the new town pool. Suppose, you conduct your survey by asking people at a rally against the new pool, all of whom are against it. Then no matter how many people you ask, your sample proportion will be 0% in favour, which is not the same as the town proportion of 50%. So, no matter how large your sample is, it will not be representative of the town.</p>
<h1>What is a biased selection technique?</h1>
<h1>Self-selection bias</h1>
<p>Example: people respond to a survey - email or phone in.</p>
<h1>What you should do</h1>
<p>If you're working with a sample of data, find out about the selection technique, and check it for bias.</p>
<h1>Sampling bias</h1>
<p>Recall the entire group of individuals of interest is called the population. It may be unrealistic or even impossible to gather data from the entire population. The subset of the population from which data are actually gathered is the sample. A sample should be selected from a population randomly, otherwise it may be prone to bias. Our goal is to obtain a sample that is representative of the population.</p>
<ul>
<li>Representative Sample. A subset of the population from which data are collected that accurately reflects the population</li>
<li>Bias. The systematic favoring of certain outcomes</li>
<li>Sampling Bias. Systematic favoring of certain outcomes due to the methods employed to obtain the sample</li>
</ul>
<h1>Types of Bias</h1>
<p>Whenever data is collected, there is a risk that the sample is biased. Here are some potential types of bias.</p>
<h1>Non-Response bias</h1>
<p>When a large percentage of those sampled do not respond or participate. Systematic favoring of certain outcomes that occurs when the individuals who choose participate in a study differ from the individuals who choose to not participate.</p>
<h1>Response bias</h1>
<p>When study participants either do not respond truthfully or give answers they feel the researcher wants to hear. For example, when students are asked if they ever cheated on an exam even those who have would respond with &quot;no.&quot; Systematic favoring of certain outcomes that occurs when participants do not respond truthfully; they may do so to align with social norms or to appease the researcher.</p>
<h1>Selection bias</h1>
<p>This bias occurs when the sample selected does not reflect the population of interest. For instance, you are interested in the attitude of female students regarding campus safety but when sampling you also include males. In this case, your population of interest was female students however your sample included subjects not in that population (i.e. males).</p>	  </main>
