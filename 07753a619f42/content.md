%% Respecting personal data %%

If you're using data that contains personal information, you need to treat it with special care.

# People can be very trusting

The need to treat personal information with special care is made even greater by the fact that people can be very trusting with their data. This is nicely demonstrated, in a TEDx talk by Daniel Goddemeyer and Dominikus Baur:

Don't abuse people's trust. It's not only immoral, but also imprudent - if you abuse people's trust then you will lose it, and once lost it can be very hard to regain.

# De-identifying data

If your data contains personal information, then one of your main responsibilities is to make sure it's **de-identified** whenever you present it: no one should be able to see, or deduce, any personal information about any particular individual.

Some things you obviously shouldn't show. You shouldn't show, for example, a list of names and their associated email addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and so on. Even without names attached you shouldn't show these things - it can be very easy to figure out which pieces of data belong to which person.

It's usually okay to present summary facts, such as, "employees have an average age of 34". But not always: if you also presented the summary fact, "employees all have the same age", then your audience would be able to deduce the age of every employee.

For another example, consider the summary fact, "employees range in age from 23 to 75". If the audience knows who the oldest employee is, then they'll be able to deduce his or her age.

Be especially careful with items of data that by themselves are sufficient to identify a person. This includes passport numbers and tax file numbers. If your presentation allows your audience to see data about the person with such-and-such passport number, or such-and-such tax file number, then they'll be able to easily find out who that person is.

But you also need to be careful about combinations of items. For example, although none of postcode, gender and date of birth by themselves is enough to identify a person, the combination of the three might be. It's surprising how easy it is to identify someone using just a few pieces of information (as you'll probably have discovered if you've ever tried to find someone on Facebook).

So be careful. De-identifying is not always straightforward.
