    <main>
      <p>If you are using data that involves personal information, then you need to be careful with how you use it.</p>
<h1>People can be very trusting</h1>
<p>People can be very trusting with their data - don't abuse this trust. For moral reasons, but also practical - you will soon lose it.</p>
<p>Watch this TEDx talk by Daniel Goddemeyer and Dominikus Baur, ‘Future (Im)perfect, The hidden Ethics of our personal Data’.</p>

<p>Nifty animations. Shows how trusting people can be, and how we need to respect that trust when sharing data.</p>
<h1>Using personal information</h1>
<p>You would usually need to de-identify the data.</p>
<p>What counts as personal information? The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) recognises that it can be difficult to determine whether a peice of information counts as personal information. Their website gives this example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Information that Sue was born with fetal alcohol syndrome reveals that her biological mother consumed alcohol during her pregnancy. This information may therefore be personal information about Sue’s mother as well as Sue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The Australian Privacy Act</h1>
<p>Privacy is governed by the Privacy Act 1988, typically viewed as the foundation of laws related to data and its use. The general objective of the act is to protect the confidentiality of personal information. It dictates what organsiations can do with information they have stored and how that information can be accessed and deleted.</p>
<p>The requirements of privacy are stipulated in thirteen <strong>Australian Privacy Principles (APP)</strong>. Here are the relevant ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>APP6. Personal information can only be used or disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected.</li>
<li>APP7. Certain conditions must be met for an organisation to use personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>To see the rest:</p>

<h1>De-identifying data</h1>
<p>There are two different types of identifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct identifiers</li>
<li>Quasi-identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p>A direct-identifier is a piece of information that is unique to a person. A single direct-identifier is capable of identifying a particular person. Examples include passport numbers and tax file numbers.</p>
<p>A quasi-identifier is not unique to a particular person. A single quasi-identifier will not identify a particular person, but multiple quasi-identifiers used together can. For example, although neither postcode, gender and date of birth will directly identify a person, Latanya Sweeney found that when combined, these three quasi-identifiers can identify a person in the USA 87% of the time. Read more about Latanya Sweeney’s research.</p>
<p>Names, phones and emails are typically not very informative anyway, except to connect tables. They don't play much of a role in statistical summaries.</p>	  </main>
