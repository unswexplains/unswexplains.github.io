      Respecting personal data    </header>
    <main>
      <p>If you're using data that contains personal information, you need to treat it with special care.</p>
<h1>People can be very trusting</h1>
<p>The need to treat personal information with special care is made even greater by the fact that people can be very trusting with their data. This is nicely demonstrated, in a TEDx talk by Daniel Goddemeyer and Dominikus Baur:</p>

<p>Don't abuse people's trust. It's not only immoral, but also imprudent - if you abuse people's trust then you will lose it, and once lost it can be very hard to regain.</p>
<h1>De-identifying data</h1>
<p>If your data contains personal information, then one of your main responsibilities is to make sure it's <strong>de-identified</strong> whenever you present it: no one should be able to see, or deduce, any personal information about any particular individual.</p>
<p>Some things you obviously shouldn't show. You shouldn't show, for example, a list of names and their associated email addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and so on. Even without names attached you shouldn't show these things - it can be very easy to figure out which pieces of data belong to which person.</p>
<p>It's usually okay to present summary facts, such as, &quot;employees have an average age of 34&quot;. But not always: if you also presented the summary fact, &quot;employees all have the same age&quot;, then your audience would be able to deduce the age of every employee.</p>
<p>For another example, consider the summary fact, &quot;employees range in age from 23 to 75&quot;. If the audience knows who the oldest employee is, then they'll be able to deduce his or her age.</p>
<p>Be especially careful with items of data that by themselves are sufficient to identify a person. This includes passport numbers and tax file numbers. If your presentation allows your audience to see data about the person with such-and-such passport number, or such-and-such tax file number, then they'll be able to easily find out who that person is.</p>
<p>But you also need to be careful about combinations of items. For example, although none of postcode, gender and date of birth by themselves is enough to identify a person, the combination of the three might be. It's surprising how easy it is to identify someone using just a few pieces of information (as you'll probably have discovered if you've ever tried to find someone on Facebook).</p>
<p>So be careful. De-identifying is not always straightforward.</p>	  </main>
