      $ The post hoc and cum hoc fallacies    </header>
    <main>
      <p>We have an insatiable appetite for causal explanations.</p>
<p>This can mislead us when analysing data, and it can mislead our audiences when we are presenting data.</p>
<p>When extracting information from data there are two causal fallacies that we are prone to commit. They can lead us to drawing false conclusions about what causes what. That lead to wasted time and effort, or, even worse, to making things worse.</p>
<h1>The post hoc fallacy</h1>
<p>Short for &quot;post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot;. Translates to &quot;after this, therefore because of this&quot;. This is a common fallacy in which the sequence of events is used to create a causal relationship. In other words, saying that one event caused another simply because it happened first.</p>
<p>The reasoning goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A occurred, then B occurred. So, A caused B.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a mistake, and a very common one. It's called the <strong>post hoc</strong> fallacy (&quot;post hoc&quot; is short for &quot;post hoc ergo propter hoc&quot;, which is latin for &quot;after this therefore because of this&quot;). </p>
<p>This is invalid reasoning, as an example shows. [Example.] </p>
<p>We're not totally gullible. Sometimes it's obviously bad reason. But when we can see a plausible causal mechanism, especially one we would like to be true, we are much more prone to it.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A tenant moves into an apartment and the building's furnace develops a fault. The manager blames the tenant's arrival for the malfunction. One event merely followed the other, in the absence of causality.[5]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brazilian footballer Pel√© blamed a dip in his playing performance on having given a fan a specific playing shirt. His play recovered after receiving from a friend what he was told was the shirt in question, despite it actually being the same shirt he'd worn during his poor performance.[6]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting of coincidental vaccine adverse events, where people have a health complaint after being vaccinated and assume it was caused by the vaccination.[7]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>The cum hoc fallacy</h1>
<p>Short for &quot;cum hoc ergo propter hoc&quot;. Literally &quot;with this therefore because of this&quot;).</p>
<p>Nor is it as simple as finding a correlation. When A happens, B happens. And when A doesn't happen, B doesn't happen.</p>
<p>This is tempting. Example.</p>
<p>But it's also a mistake, and also common. It's called the <strong>cum hoc</strong> fallacy (&quot;cum hoc&quot; is short for &quot;cum hoc ergo propter hoc&quot;, which is latin for &quot;with this therefore because of this&quot;). The reasoning goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When A happens, B happens. And when A doesn't happen, B doesn't happen<br>
Therefore, A causes B</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is invalid reasoning, as an example shows. [Ice cream sales and shark attacks.]</p>
<p>Again, we're not totally gullible. But we often are.</p>
<p>Events of one kind are correlated with events of another kind, and we conclude that one causes the other. The chronological ordering might be unknown.</p>
<p>Example of a tempting plot.</p>
<p>The relationship could be the reverse of what you expected to be true.</p>
<p>Could be a common cause. Larger markets are likely to have larger sales and larger advertising budgets, whereas smaller markets are likely to have less sales and smaller advertising budgets.</p>
<p><a href="href=&quot;http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">Spurious Correlations</a></p>
<p>There are typically numerous other possible reasons that might underlie the correlation (unless we're conducting a randomized controlled experiment).</p>
<p>We are not completely gullible. A case in which we are not tempted to be fooled is this: roosters crow at sunrise. It's when we can see a plausible causal connection. We too quickly settle upon it.</p>
<h1>Possible explanations</h1>
<p>There are at least four other possible explanations of the correlation.</p>
<p>First, phenomena of type b, and only phenomena of type b, cause phenomena of type p. Here is a correlation that is correctly explained in this kind of way: there is lightning if and only if there is thunder. Correct explanation: lightning, and only lightning, causes thunder. That lightning causes thunder explains why there is lightening only if there is thunder, and that only lightning causes thunder explains why there is lightning if there is thunder.</p>
<p>Second, phenomena of type p, and only phenomena of type p, cause phenomena of type b. (That is, the direction of explanation could be the reverse of the one above.)</p>
<p>Third, phenomena of type b cause phenomena of type p, and phenomena of type p cause phenomena of type b. Here is a correlation that is correctly explained in this kind of way: whenever I send an email to my mum, my mum sends an email to me, and vice-versa. Correct explanation: my sending an email to my mum causes her to send an email to me (this explains why, whenever I send an email to my mum, she sends an email to me), and her sending an email to me causes me to send an email to her (this explains why, whenever my mum sends an email to me, I send an email to her). Also: getting fit and exercising.</p>
<p>Fourth, there is a type of phenomenon c such that phenomena of type c, and only phenomena of type c, cause both phenomena of type b and phenomena of type p. Here is a correlation that is correctly explained in this kind of way: whenever the cars traveling north-south at the intersection stop, the cars traveling east-west start, and vice-versa. Correct explanation: the starting and stopping are both caused by, and only by, the changing of the traffic lights.</p>
<p>There is another possibility that we should also consider: that there is no explanation of the mind-brain correlation thesis, because the correlations are merely coincidental. The chance of it being true is small if we have a large sample.</p>
<p>Because of all these alternative possible explanations, we should not accept one unless we can rule the others out.</p>
<h1>Correlation and Causation</h1>
<p>For example, you might suspect that the number of times children wash their hands might be causally related to the number of cases of the common cold amongst the children at a pre-school. However, it is also possible that children who have colds are made to wash their hands more often. In this example, it would also be important to evaluate the timing of the measured variables - does an increase in the amount of hand washing precede a decrease in colds or did it happen at the same time?</p>
<p>Check whether changes in the explanatory variable contribute, along with other variables, to changes in the response. For example, the amount of dry brush in a forest does not cause a forest fire; but it will contribute to it if a fire is ignited.</p>
<p>Check for confounders or common causes that may affect both the explanatory and response variables. For example, there is a moderate association between whether a baby is breastfed or bottle-fed and the number of incidences of gastroenteritis recorded on medical charts (with the breastfed babies showing more cases). But it turns out that breastfed babies also have, on average, more routine medical visits to pediatricians. Thus, the number of opportunities for mild cases of gastroenteritis to be recorded on medical charts is greater for the breastfed babies providing a clear confounder.</p>
<p>Check whether both variables may have changed together over time or space. For example, data on the number of cases of internet fraud and on the amount spent on election campaigns in the United States taken over the last 30 years would have a strong association merely because they have both increased over time. As another example, if you examine the percent of the population with home computers and the life expectancy for every country in the world, there will be a positive association merely because richer countries have both how life expectancy and greater computer use. Tyler Vigen's website lists thousands of spurious correlations that result from variables that coincidentally change the same way over time.</p>
<p>Check whether the association between the variables might be just a matter of coincidence. This is where a check for the degree of statistical significance would be important. However, it is also important to consider whether the search for significance was a priori or a posteriori. For example, a story in the national news one year reported that at a hospital in Potsdam, New York, 15 babies in a row were all boys. Does that indicate that something at that hospital was causing more male than female births? Clearly, the answer is no, even if the chance of having 15 boys in a row is quite low (about 1 chance in 33,000). But there are over 5000 hospitals in the United States and the story would be just as newsworthy if it happened at any one of them at any time of the year and for either 15 boys in a row or for 15 girls in a row. Thus, it turns out that we actually expect a story like this to happen once or twice a year somewhere in the United States every year.</p>	  </main>
