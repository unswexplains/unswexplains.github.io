%% $ Responsibly analysing data %%

# Make sure you have permission to use the data

# Check the quality of the data

Sampling, measurements, currency.

Sometimes you can trust the source - BOM, ABS.

Other times not.

# Don't cherry-pick the data

E.g. customer feedback. student feedback.

Beware of confirmation bias. Selectively interpreting data. We seek data that supports a theory, rather than data that violates it.

When "fact checking" we natural look to confirm a story rather than checking the facts and looking for an alternative story. Example: checking whether such-and-such happened.

# Don't draw inferences about the population

Unless you know what you're doing.

It's okay to note things that suggest further investigation.

# Don't make predictions

Unless you know what you're doing - use the right techniques.

Traps.

# Don't draw causal conclusions

Donâ€™t draw causal conclusions (e.g. correlation is not causation). We need to be sure that we are interpreting data accurately. It can be easy to draw conclusions from data which are not warranted.

It's okay to note things for further investigation.

# Take care

With calculations - double check them.

Other people might be relying on you.

# Be transparent

Make it possible for others to see what you've done. Or your future self. Using R helps with this.
