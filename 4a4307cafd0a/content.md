# Check whether you have permission to use it

# Check the quality of the data

You should check whether your data is correct.

# Don't cherry-pick the data

Beware of confirmation bias. Selectively interpreting data. We seek data that supports a theory, rather than data that violates it. When "fact checking" we natural look to confirm a story rather than checking the facts and looking for an alternative story.

# Don't jump to conclusions

Donâ€™t jump to conclusions (e.g. correlation is not causation). We need to be sure that we are interpreting data accurately. It can be easy to draw conclusions from data which are not warranted.

# Don't extrapolate

The extension of a past trend into the future without any evidence that the trend will continue.

# Be careful about reinforcing biases

Example: hiring data that reflects biased practices, or prejudices, or stereotypes.

Just because there has been association between two variables so far, it doesn't follow that it is one that we want to continue.
