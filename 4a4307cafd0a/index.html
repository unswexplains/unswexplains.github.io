    <main>
      <h1>Make sure you have permission to use the data</h1>
<h1>Check the quality of the data</h1>
<p>Sampling, measurements, currency.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can trust the source - BOM, ABS.</p>
<p>Other times not.</p>
<h1>Don't cherry-pick the data</h1>
<p>E.g. customer feedback. student feedback.</p>
<p>Beware of confirmation bias. Selectively interpreting data. We seek data that supports a theory, rather than data that violates it.</p>
<p>When &quot;fact checking&quot; we natural look to confirm a story rather than checking the facts and looking for an alternative story. Example: checking whether such-and-such happened.</p>
<h1>Don't draw inferences about the population</h1>
<p>Unless you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>It's okay to note things that suggest further investigation.</p>
<h1>Don't make predictions</h1>
<p>Unless you know what you're doing - use the right techniques.</p>
<p>Traps.</p>
<h1>Don't draw causal conclusions</h1>
<p>Donâ€™t draw causal conclusions (e.g. correlation is not causation). We need to be sure that we are interpreting data accurately. It can be easy to draw conclusions from data which are not warranted.</p>
<p>It's okay to note things for further investigation.</p>
<h1>Compare fair things</h1>
<p>Number of church goers has risen, sure, but what about the proportion? General population has risen too.</p>
<h1>Take care</h1>
<p>With calculations - double check them.</p>
<p>Other people might be relying on you.</p>
<h1>Reported data</h1>
<p>Be aware of what data comes from reports. Rates of infection have dropped, versus reported rates of infection have dropped.</p>
<h1>Be transparent</h1>
<p>Make it possible for others to see what you've done. Or your future self. Using R helps with this.</p>	  </main>
